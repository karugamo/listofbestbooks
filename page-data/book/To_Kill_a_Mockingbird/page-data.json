It went on to win the Pulitzer Prize in 1961 and was later made into an Academy Award-winning film, also a classic.\n\nCompassionate, dramatic, and deeply moving, \"To Kill A Mockingbird\" takes readers to the roots of human behavior - to innocence and experience, kindness and cruelty, love and hatred, humor and pathos.
