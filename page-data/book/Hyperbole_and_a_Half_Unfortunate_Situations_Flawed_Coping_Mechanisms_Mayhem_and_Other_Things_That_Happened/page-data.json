Because I wrote it, I had to figure out what to put on the back cover to explain what it is. I tried to write a long, third-person summary that would imply how great the book is and also sound vaguely authoritative--like maybe someone who isn’t me wrote it--but I soon discovered that I’m not sneaky enough to pull it off convincingly. So I decided to just make a list of things that are in the book:\n\nPictures\nWords\nStories about things that happened to me\nStories about things that happened to other people because of me\nEight billion dollars*\nStories about dogs\nThe secret to eternal happiness*\n\n*These are lies. Perhaps I have underestimated my sneakiness!","author":"Allie Brosh","pages":371}}},
