Through the gripping events of their story, Dostoevsky portrays the whole of Russian life, is social and spiritual striving, in what was both the golden age and a tragic turning point in Russian culture.\n\nThis award-winning translation by Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky remains true to the verbal\ninventiveness of Dostoevsky’s prose, preserving the multiple voices, the humor, and the surprising modernity of the original. It is an achievement worthy of Dostoevsky’s last and greatest novel.","author":"Fyodor Dostoevsky","pages":796}}},
