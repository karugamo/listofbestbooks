It now has 600,000 to a million page hits daily. Every now and then, Munroe would get emails asking him to arbitrate a science debate. 'My friend and I were arguing about what would happen if a bullet got struck by lightning, and we agreed that you should resolve it . . . ' He liked these questions so much that he started up What If. \n\nIf your cells suddenly lost the power to divide, how long would you survive?\n\n How dangerous is it, really, to be in a swimming pool in a thunderstorm?\n\n If we hooked turbines to people exercising in gyms, how much power could we produce?\n\n What if everyone only had one soulmate?\n\nWhen (if ever) did the sun go down on the British empire? \n\n How fast can you hit a speed bump while driving and live?\n\nWhat would happen if the moon went away?\n\nIn pursuit of answers, Munroe runs computer simulations, pores over stacks of declassified military research memos, solves differential equations, and consults with nuclear reactor operators. His responses are masterpieces of clarity and hilarity, studded with memorable cartoons and infographics. They often predict the complete annihilation of humankind, or at least a really big explosion. Far more than a book for geeks, WHAT IF: Serious Scientific Answers to Absurd Hypothetical Questions explains the laws of science in operation in a way that every intelligent reader will enjoy and feel much the smarter for having read.","author":"Randall Munroe","pages":303}}},
