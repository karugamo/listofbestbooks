Roxane Coss, opera's most revered soprano, has mesmerized the international guests with her singing. It is a perfect eveningâ€”until a band of gun-wielding terrorists takes the entire party hostage. But what begins as a panicked, life-threatening scenario slowly evolves into something quite different, a moment of great beauty, as terrorists and hostages forge unexpected bonds and people from different continents become compatriots, intimate friends, and lovers.","author":"Ann Patchett"}}},
