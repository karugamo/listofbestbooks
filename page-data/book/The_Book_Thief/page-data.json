Nazi Germany. The country is holding its breath. Death has never been busier, and will be busier still.\n\nBy her brother's graveside, Liesel's life is changed when she picks up a single object, partially hidden in the snow. It is The Gravedigger's Handbook, left behind there by accident, and it is her first act of book thievery. So begins a love affair with books and words, as Liesel, with the help of her accordian-playing foster father, learns to read. Soon she is stealing books from Nazi book-burnings, the mayor's wife's library, wherever there are books to be found.\n\nBut these are dangerous times. When Liesel's foster family hides a Jew in their basement, Liesel's world is both opened up, and closed down.\n\nIn superbly crafted writing that burns with intensity, award-winning author Markus Zusak has given us one of the most enduring stories of our time.\n\n(Note: this title was not published as YA fiction)","author":"Markus Zusak","pages":552}}},
