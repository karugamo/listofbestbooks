Black T-shirts, headphones, head in a bookâ€”he thinks he's made himself invisible. But not to Eleanor... never to Eleanor.\n\nSlowly, steadily, through late-night conversations and an ever-growing stack of mix tapes, Eleanor and Park fall for each other. They fall in love the way you do the first time, when you're young, and you feel as if you have nothing and everything to lose.","author":"Rainbow Rowell"}}},
