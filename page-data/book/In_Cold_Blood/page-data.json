There was no apparent motive for the crime, and there were almost no clues. \n\nAs Truman Capote reconstructs the murder and the investigation that led to the capture, trial, and execution of the killers, he generates both mesmerizing suspense and astonishing empathy. In Cold Blood is a work that transcends its moment, yielding poignant insights into the nature of American violence.","author":"Truman Capote","pages":343}}},
