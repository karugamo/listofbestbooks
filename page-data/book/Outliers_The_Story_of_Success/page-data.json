He asks the question: what makes high-achievers different?\n\nHis answer is that we pay too much attention to what successful people are like, and too little attention to where they are from: that is, their culture, their family, their generation, and the idiosyncratic experiences of their upbringing. Along the way he explains the secrets of software billionaires, what it takes to be a great soccer player, why Asians are good at math, and what made the Beatles the greatest rock band.\n\nBrilliant and entertaining, Outliers is a landmark work that will simultaneously delight and illuminate.","author":"Malcolm Gladwell"}}},
