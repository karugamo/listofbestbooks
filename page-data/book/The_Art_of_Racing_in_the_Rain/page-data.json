On the eve of his death, Enzo takes stock of his life, recalling all that he and his family have been through.\n\nA heart-wrenching but deeply funny and ultimately uplifting story of family, love, loyalty, and hope, The Art of Racing in the Rain is a beautifully crafted and captivating look at the wonders and absurdities of human life ... as only a dog could tell it.","author":"Garth Stein"}}},
