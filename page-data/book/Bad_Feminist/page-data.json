I used to say my favorite color was black to be cool, but it is pink—all shades of pink. If I have an accessory, it is probably pink. I read Vogue, and I’m not doing it ironically, though it might seem that way. I once live-tweeted the September issue.\n\nIn these funny and insightful essays, Roxane Gay takes us through the journey of her evolution as a woman of color while also taking readers on a ride through culture of the last few years and commenting on the state of feminism today. The portrait that emerges is not only one of an incredibly insightful woman continually growing to understand herself and our society, but also one of our culture.\n\nBad Feminist is a sharp, funny, and spot-on look at the ways in which the culture we consume becomes who we are, and an inspiring call-to-arms of all the ways we still need to do better.\n\nFeel me, see me, hear me, reach me --\nPeculiar benefits --\nTypical first year professor --\nTo scratch, claw or grope clumsily or frantically --\nHow to be friends with another woman --\nGirls, girls, girls --\nI once was Miss America --\nGarish, glorious spectacles --\nNot here to make friends --\nHow we all lose --\nReaching for catharsis : getting fat right (or wrong) and Diana Spechler's Skinny --\nThe smooth surfaces of idyll --\nThe careless language of sexual violence --\nWhat we hunger for --\nThe illusion of safety/the safety of illusion --\nThe spectacle of broken men --\nA tale of three coming out stories --\nBeyond the measure of men --\nSome jokes are funnier than others --\nDear young ladies who love Chris Brown --\nSo much they would let him beat them --\nBlurred lines, indeed --\nThe trouble with Prince Charming, or, He who trespassed against us --\nThe solace of preparing fried foods and other quaint remembrances from 1960s Mississippi : thoughts on The help --\nSurviving Django --\nBeyond the struggle narrative --\nThe morality of Tyler Perry --\nThe last day of a young black man --\nWhen less is more --\nThe politics of respectability --\nWhen Twitter does what journalism cannot --\nThe alienable rights of women --\nHolding out for a hero --\nA tale of two profiles --\nThe racism we all carry --\nTragedy, call, compassion, response --\nBad feminist : take one --\nBad feminist : take two","author":"Roxane Gay"}}},
