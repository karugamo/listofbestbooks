Fight Club’s estranged narrator leaves his lackluster job when he comes under the thrall of Tyler Durden, an enigmatic young man who holds secret after-hours boxing matches in the basement of bars. There, two men fight \"as long as they have to.\" This is a gloriously original work that exposes the darkness at the core of our modern world.","author":"Chuck Palahniuk"}}},
