By 1988 she was living at home but was brain dead after a tragic cycle of misunderstanding, over-medication, and culture clash: \"What the doctors viewed as clinical efficiency the Hmong viewed as frosty arrogance.\" The Spirit Catches You and You Fall Down is a tragedy of Shakespearean dimensions, written with the deepest of human feeling. Sherwin Nuland said of the account, \"There are no villains in Fadiman's tale, just as there are no heroes. People are presented as she saw them, in their humility and their frailtyâ€”and their nobility.","author":"Anne Fadiman"}}},
