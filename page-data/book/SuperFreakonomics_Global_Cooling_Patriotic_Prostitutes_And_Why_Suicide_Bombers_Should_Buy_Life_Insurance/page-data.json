Now, Steven D. Levitt and Stephen J. Dubner return with SuperFreakonomics, and fans and newcomers alike will find that the freakquel is even bolder, funnier, and more surprising than the first.\n\nFour years in the making, SuperFreakonomics asks not only the tough questions, but the unexpected ones: What's more dangerous, driving drunk or walking drunk? Why is chemotherapy prescribed so often if it's so ineffective? Can a sex change boost your salary?\n\nSuperFreakonomics challenges the way we think all over again, exploring the hidden side of everything with such questions as:\n\nHow is a street prostitute like a department-store Santa?\nWhy are doctors so bad at washing their hands?\nHow much good do car seats do?\nWhat's the best way to catch a terrorist?\nDid TV cause a rise in crime?\nWhat do hurricanes, heart attacks, and highway deaths have in common?\nAre people hard-wired for altruism or selfishness?\nCan eating kangaroo save the planet?\nWhich adds more value: a pimp or a Realtor?\n\nLevitt and Dubner mix smart thinking and great storytelling like no one else, whether investigating a solution to global warming or explaining why the price of oral sex has fallen so drastically. By examining how people respond to incentives, they show the world for what it really is – good, bad, ugly, and, in the final analysis, super freaky.\n\nFreakonomics has been imitated many times over – but only now, with SuperFreakonomics, has it met its match.","author":"Steven D.
