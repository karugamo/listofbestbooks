The damaged machinery, unforgiving environment, or plain-old “human error” are much more likely to kill him first. \n\nBut Mark isn’t ready to give up yet. Drawing on his ingenuity, his engineering skills — and a relentless, dogged refusal to quit — he steadfastly confronts one seemingly insurmountable obstacle after the next. Will his resourcefulness be enough to overcome the impossible odds against him?\n\n","author":"Andy Weir"}}},
