She posted a piece on her blog, entitled: 'Why I'm No Longer Talking to White People About Race' that led to this book.\n\nExploring issues from eradicated black history to the political purpose of white dominance, whitewashed feminism to the inextricable link between class and race, Reni Eddo-Lodge offers a timely and essential new framework for how to see, acknowledge and counter racism. It is a searing, illuminating, absolutely necessary exploration of what it is to be a person of colour in Britain today.","author":"Reni Eddo-Lodge","pages":249}}},
