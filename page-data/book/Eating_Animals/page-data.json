Once he started a family, the moral dimensions of food became increasingly important.\n\n\nFaced with the prospect of being unable to explain why we eat some animals and not others, Foer set out to explore the origins of many eating traditions and the fictions involved with creating them. Traveling to the darkest corners of our dining habits, Foer raises the unspoken question behind every fish we eat, every chicken we fry, and every burger we grill.\n\n\nPart memoir and part investigative report, Eating Animals is a book that, in the words of the Los Angeles Times, places Jonathan Safran Foer \"at the table with our greatest philosophers.\" \n","author":"Jonathan Safran Foer"}}},
