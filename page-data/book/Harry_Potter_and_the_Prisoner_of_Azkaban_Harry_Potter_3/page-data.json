Convicted of killing thirteen people with a single curse, he was said to be the heir apparent to the Dark Lord, Voldemort.\n\nNow he has escaped, leaving only two clues as to where he might be headed: Harry Potter's defeat of You-Know-Who was Black's downfall as well. And the Azkaban guards heard Black muttering in his sleep, \"He's at Hogwarts . . . he's at Hogwarts.\"\n\nHarry Potter isn't safe, not even within the walls of his magical school, surrounded by his friends. Because on top of it all, there may well be a traitor in their midst.","author":"J.K. Rowling"}}},
