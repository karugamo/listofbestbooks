She also had a dream that one day she would be a comedian on TV.\n\nShe has seen both these dreams come true.\n\nAt last, Tina Fey's story can be told. From her youthful days as a vicious nerd to her tour of duty on Saturday Night Live; from her passionately halfhearted pursuit of physical beauty to her life as a mother eating things off the floor; from her one-sided college romance to her nearly fatal honeymoonâ€”from the beginning of this paragraph to this final sentence.\n\nTina Fey reveals all, and proves what we've all suspected: you're no one until someone calls you bossy.","author":"Tina Fey","pages":283}}},
